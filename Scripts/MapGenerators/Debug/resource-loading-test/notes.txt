Resource Loading Test Task
==========================

Problem:
--------
The map generation script (generate_cosmos_002_training_world.py) is failing to load assets.
Map file size remains at 22848 bytes, indicating no new content is being generated.
The script's place_training_room() method calls load_asset() which returns None.

Constraint:
-----------
MUST use the exact asset paths from the original script. Do NOT suggest alternative assets.
If assets don't exist, it means there's a problem with how we're referencing them.

Test Approach:
--------------
Created test_asset_loading.py that:
1. Uses EXACT same asset paths as generate_cosmos_002_training_world.py
2. Uses EXACT same loading method: editor_asset_lib.load_asset(path)
3. Checks if each asset exists using does_asset_exist()
4. Reports detailed diagnostics for each asset
5. Identifies WHY load_asset() returns None

Assets Being Tested (from original script):
--------------------------------------------
- /Game/LevelPrototyping/Meshes/SM_Cube
- /Game/LevelPrototyping/Meshes/SM_Plane
- /Game/LevelPrototyping/Materials/MI_PrototypeGrid_Gray
- /Game/LevelPrototyping/Materials/MI_PrototypeGrid_Gray_02
- /Game/LevelPrototyping/Materials/MI_PrototypeGrid_TopDark

How to Run:
-----------
1. Double-click test_asset_loading.bat
2. Wait for UE5 to start and run the test
3. Check the output for diagnostic information

Possible Causes:
----------------
1. Asset paths are incorrect (typo, wrong case, wrong location)
2. Assets need to be loaded differently in command-line mode
3. Assets need time to compile/load before being accessible
4. LevelPrototyping plugin is not enabled or content is not imported
5. Python API has different behavior in -unattended mode

Expected Outcome:
-----------------
The test will tell us:
- Which assets exist vs don't exist
- Which assets load successfully vs return None
- The exact error messages if any exceptions occur
This will help us fix the asset loading in the main script.
